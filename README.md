This is the worlds most shitty password generator. How to use
> [!NOTE]
>
> u can put smnthn in "passwrd" but you have to put it in the '' like this:
```python
passwrd = 'github_'
```
To change the length of password change 30 to wtv
```python
length = 69
```
Then run the file it should obviously fucking work unless you're actually stupid and messed something up somehow\
Ok now ur done it should be in the console
